# twitchchatbot
Example basic Chatbot for managing user requests for media on stream.

## Setup
Copy the example configurations src/main/resources/youtubeConfig.yaml and src/main/resources/config.yaml and update them with your API keys.

## Additional Work needed
* More would need to be done to ensure that users cannot request any content that you do not have authorization to air.
* Preventing user abuse of the system
